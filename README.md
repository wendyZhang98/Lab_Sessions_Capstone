# 🧑🏻‍🏫 NYU CDS – DS-GA 1006 Capstone Lab Sessions

*Reproducible Machine Learning Workflows on HPC & Cloud — Taught at NYU Center for Data Science (CDS)*

This repository contains lab materials I prepared and taught as a **Section Leader (TA)** for the **Data Science Capstone Course** at the [NYU Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/).

These labs are designed to help students build practical, reproducible, and scalable data science workflows using **Greene HPC**, **GCP Cloud**, **Slurm**, and **PyTorch**.

## 🧭 Labs Overview

- **Lab 1 – HPC & Cloud Access**  
  Setting up SSH keys, connecting to Greene and GCP via Slurm, and configuring VS Code Remote for seamless development.  

- **Lab 2 – Data & Environment Management**  
  Best practices for organizing projects, managing Python environments, and preparing data for large-scale ML tasks.  

- **Lab 3 – NLP Pipeline (Yelp Reviews)**  
  Building a text classification workflow using HuggingFace Transformers and PyTorch Trainer with GPU acceleration and TensorBoard tracking.  

- **Lab 4 – Computer Vision Pipeline (Places365)**  
  Training an image classification model using PyTorch Lightning-style training, mixed precision, and a multi-GPU setup.
